Musical Guess
=============
This was the first project for Declarative Programming COMP30020 at The University of Melbourne Semester 2 2018. 
It was probably one of my favourite assignments; working with Haskell ended up being really intellectually stimulating and interesting.

Also, take a look at the [helper program](https://github.com/samuel-x/COMP30020-helper) which was used to iterate through all possible cases
and calculate an average score for the program.

I ended up with a fairly high score, so this repo, along with [Puzzle Solver](https://github.com/samuel-x/Maths-Puzzle-Solver) (the second project for this course) are a pretty good indicator of what's expected.
